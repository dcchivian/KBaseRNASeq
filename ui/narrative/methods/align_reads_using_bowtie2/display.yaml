            RNA-seq Sample  
        short-hint : |
            Select the RNA-seq sample associated with the reads

            Indexed Genome
        short-hint : |
            Specify the indexed genome built using Bowtie2

    output_obj_name :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Output
        short-hint : |
            Provide the name of Bowtie2 read alignment output
    alignment_type :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the alignment type
        long-hint : |
            By default, Bowtie2 performs end-to-end read alignment. It searches for alignments involving all of read characters. For local option, it can clip some read characters from one or both ends of the alignment to maximize the alignment score.
    quality_score :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Quality Score Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the quality score type depending on the sequencing platform
        long-hint : |
            phred33 is used by Illumina starting with v1.8
    preset_options :
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Type Preset Options
        short-hint : |
            Select the preset options based on alignment type
        long-hint : |
            Faster option is generally less sensitive and vice versa.

description : |
    <p>This method aligns the sequencing reads to long reference sequences of a prokaryotic genome using Bowtie2. </p>
    
    <p>This method takes a Bowtie2 index object and a sequencing read file and outputs a set of alignments in BAM format.</p> 
    
    <p>In addition, it outputs the alignment statistics such as total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in the table format.</p>
    
    <p>Bowtie2 supports end-to-end read alignment mode by default. In this mode, it searches for alignments involving all of the read characters. This is also called an "untrimmed" or "unclipped" alignment. The method also supports "local" alignment mode, which produces alignments that might be "trimmed" (or "soft clipped") at one or both extremes in a way that optimizes the alignment score.</p>
    
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong>This method currently does not support batch processing of all the read samples. Therefore, this method must be run individually for each of the RNA-seq samples. Please stay tuned for the batch version of this method that will be available in near future.</p>
